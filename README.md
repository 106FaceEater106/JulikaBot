# JulikaBot
Julika bot is a pixel bot written in python for league of legends. The main purpose of this bot is to autolevel accounts and/or farm BE.
The development of this bot is in its early stage and all help is welcome!

## Adding own bot functionality
In the bots folder you'll find code for two bots that have been added as example, namely sivir and soraka bot.
If you want to add your own bot functionality / logic you can copy one of those files and edit the logic to specify how the bot should make decisions.

## Settings
This bot was developed for the following settings:
- Screen resolution: 1920x1080
- Client resolution: 1280x720
- In game resolution: 1280x720
- Window mode: windowed

All other settings should be default!

## How to run
